					<p>Impact Research NZ was commissioned by Brainwave Trust Aotearoa to review their existing documents and evaluate the
						effectiveness of their programmes and seminars for those attending. The aim of the project was to develop and pilot
						a Results Based Accountability (RBA) framework and tools to measure their activities from the perspectives of key stakeholders

						trust that aims to raise public awareness around healthy brain development in babies, young children and adolescents.
						They deliver seminars and programmes based on robust scientific research to a variety of organisations and individuals
						who have an interest in ensuring the safety and wellbeing of young New Zealanders.</p>
					<p>The project involved seven key areas for investigation:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The views of staff and Educators were sought via an online survey on how effective the organisation is in achieving
							its aims and objectives, the quality of presentation and programme development and delivery as well as areas for improvement.</li>
						<li>Brainwave School’s programme asked secondary school students via an online survey and student focus group about the
							effectiveness of the programme. Staff members were asked via an online survey about the alignment with the school
							curriculum and areas for improvement.
						</li>

							by the Canterbury earthquakes. Selected parents and caregivers were invited to share their experiences of attending
							seminars via a focus group and online survey. Professionals from referring agencies such as CYF, police and Plunket
							via an online survey were invited to share their views on the effectiveness of the seminar for those who they referred.</li>
						<li>The views of groups and organisations who book Brainwave presentations were asked via an online survey if their needs
							and expectations were met by the presentations.</li>

							vision and mission, as well as adhering to the principles of its strategic direction and the effectiveness of the
							programmes.</li>
						<li>Key stakeholders (e.g. NGOs, professionals working with vulnerable children and adolescents) were asked via an online
							survey about their engagement with Brainwave and how well the presentations were received by those attending and areas
							for improvement.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>An overall synthesis report was provided to Brainwave which highlighted key findings that will be used to inform their
						strategic direction and utilisation of the newly created RBA framework.</p>

					<p>The research project undertook two stages of data collection. In stage one, a document review and analysis was undertaken

								<strong>Results Based Assessment</strong>
							</a>
							<br>Results Based Assessment (RBA) is a type of evaluation that measures outcomes. Government departments, not-for-profit
							organisations and educational services are increasingly relying on RBA to provide evidence for the success and quality
							of their practices. PSN has been at the forefront of RBA development since 2009. Using specially designed survey tools,
							PSN collects information from Family Works, Enliven, Coactive and Budgeting Services.

							of their college-age, school children. The catch-up class is a collaborative effort between families and community.
							The majority of students are Somali and Eritrean.
